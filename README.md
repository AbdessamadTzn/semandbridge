“SemanDBridge” is a cutting-edge research project dedicated to bridging the gap between traditional SQL databases and large language models (LLMs) by overlaying an AI-powered semantic knowledge graph. Unlike conventional text-to-SQL systems, this framework analyzes database schemas with LLMs to generate rich business descriptions, confidence scores, and semantic relationships (both explicit and implicit), all structured within a Neo4j graph.

By combining advanced concepts from knowledge graphs, vector similarity, and retrieval-augmented generation—approaches validated by recent PhD research—SemanDBridge enables LLM agents to interpret complex business context, discover hidden links across tables, and deliver more accurate, explainable queries. This project not only advances the state of the art, but also serves as a foundational step for future research into intelligent semantic data integration and AI-powered business analytics.
